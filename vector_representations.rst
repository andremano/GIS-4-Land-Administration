Vector representations
======================

A common way to represent real world objects in a GIS is using a vector data model to do it.
This exercise will introduce the basic concepts and rationale behind the vector model.

Basics of the vector model
--------------------------

The vector model uses the most basic geometric primitive - the point, to construct more complex geometries like lines and polygons.
Each point is defined by its X and Y coordinates in the case of 2D geometries and also a Z coordinate in the case of 3D geometries.

The coordinates associated to the vector representations are anchored to a Coordinate Reference System (CRS), but this exercise is not covering CRS.
