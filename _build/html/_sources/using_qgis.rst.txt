Getting started
---------------

.. admonition:: Resources

   | For this exercise you will need this `dataset <https://github.com/andremano/GIS-4-Land-Administration/raw/master/_static/datasets/using_qgis.zip/>`_. The dataset contains the following layers:

   - *power_cables.gpkg* (vector layer containing the power lines of Addis Ababa)
   - *residential_areas.gpkg* (vector layer containing residential areas of Addis Ababa)
   - *rivers.gpkg* (vector layer containing the main water lines of Addis Ababa)
   - *main_roads.gpkg* (vector layer containing the main roads of Addis Ababa)


#. **Task** Start QGIS and add the three layers

#. **Task** Go to ``Plugins > Manage and install plugins...`` the plugin *Quick map services* and add one base map to your project.

#. **Task** In the ``Layer's panel`` create two groups (i.e. folders): one called *artifitial* and another one called *natural*

#. **Task** Drag the *residential_areas*, *power_cables* and *main_roads* into the group *artificial* and the rivers layer into the group *natural*.

#. **Task** Re-order the groups and the layers inside in such a way that all the layers are visible.

#. **Task** Save your QGIS project and share it with a colleague.

#. **Task** Open a project created by a colleague.

#. **Task** Re-arrange one or two toolbars in a way that it is convenient.

#. **Task** Make sure the ``Processing panel`` is visible
